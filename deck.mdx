# Writing Good issues

- Look for the issue first. Make it if it doesn't exist
- Give context
- Have a reproduction
- Give system details / dependency versions

---

# Which one is better

1. HELP! Site is UNUSABLE in Safari! Fine everywhere else!
2. [gatsby-remark-images]: backgroundColor option not working for transparent pngs

# What do you want to see in a good issue?

# Writing Good PRs

- Does a single task
- Reference the issue at hand
- Describe why, not how
- Maintain conventions (Code Style)
- Verify CI passes
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)

> "A pull request is the start of a conversation."

# What else do you think makes a good PR?

---

# It's not just about the code as well

- Write docs
- Help with design (Logo, Website, etc)
- Promote on Social Media
- Write blogposts / tutorials
- Discuss at meetups
- Answer Questions

---

# But OSS is daunting

- Look for "Good First Issue" or "Help Wanted" labels
- Ask maintainers for help.
- Pair programming
- Look for a mentor (Ex: [CodingCoach](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/))

---

# OSS strives from good human behavior

- Be patient with PRs
- Maintainers want to help the best they can with what they have
- be a reasonable human being
